Here’s a README template for your updated script that simulates random clicks and uses the pyautogui (aliased as pyauto) library to trigger a “Win” key press.

Random Click & Win Key Virus

Description

The Random Click & Win Key Virus is a Python script that performs two actions: it randomly simulates mouse clicks across the screen and presses the “Windows” key (WinLeft) multiple times. This script is designed for educational and research purposes only, demonstrating basic automation techniques such as random mouse movement and keyboard input using Python.

Disclaimer

This script is intended purely for educational purposes. Running this on your machine without understanding the code or its effects could cause unexpected disruptions in your workflow. Always use such scripts responsibly and only with the consent of the user. By using this script, you accept full responsibility for any consequences.

Features

	•	Random Mouse Clicks: Clicks are simulated at random screen locations within the standard screen resolution.
	•	Presses “Win” Key: Simulates pressing the “Windows” key (WinLeft).
	•	Customizable Duration: Customize the number of clicks and the duration between actions.
	•	Python-based Automation: Uses the pyautogui (aliased as pyauto) library for mouse and keyboard automation.

Prerequisites

You need to install the pyautogui library to run this script. Use the following command to install the required dependencies:

pip install pyautogui

Usage

	1.	Clone the repository or download the script to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/1Godzilla/virus-building.git


	2.	Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.
	3.	Run the script using Python:

python random_click_win_virus.py


	4.	The script will begin executing, clicking randomly on the screen and simulating “Win” key presses.

Script Overview

import random
import pyautogui as pyauto

# Loop for 15 iterations
for i in range(15):
    # Generate random screen height (0-1080) and width (0-1920)
    h = random.randint(0, 1080)
    w = random.randint(0, 1920)
    
    # Simulate a mouse click at the random position
    pyauto.click(h, w, duration=0.3)
    
    # Simulate pressing the 'Win' key (left Windows key)
    pyauto.hotkey('winleft')

How It Works

	1.	The script runs for 15 iterations. During each iteration:
	•	It generates random screen coordinates (h and w), within a resolution of 1080p (height: 1080, width: 1920).
	•	It performs a mouse click at the randomly generated position with a small duration of 0.3 seconds to simulate a more natural click.
	•	It presses the Windows key (WinLeft) to open the Start menu or trigger the Windows-related shortcuts.

Important Notes

	•	Be Cautious: The script will continuously click randomly and press the Windows key. Running this script without supervision could interfere with your normal computer use. It’s recommended to run the script in a safe, controlled environment (e.g., virtual machine or sandbox).
	•	Security Warning: Do not run this script on systems without permission. It is your responsibility to ensure that this is used for ethical and legal purposes only.
	•	Interrupting the Script: If you need to stop the script, you can interrupt it by pressing Ctrl + C in your terminal or closing the terminal window.
